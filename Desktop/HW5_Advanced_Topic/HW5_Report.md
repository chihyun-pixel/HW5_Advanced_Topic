## 1. Assignment Overview

This assignment explores advanced AI applications through hands-on implementation.
Three independent tasks were completed:

1. AI vs Human text detection system  
2. n8n-based AI automation workflow  
3. AI-assisted PowerPoint redesign  

The goal of this homework is to demonstrate the practical integration of AI models,
automation tools, and content generation techniques.

## 2. Q1 — AI / Human Text Detector

### 2.1 Objective

To build a simple system that classifies whether a given text is written by a human
or generated by AI, and display the result interactively.

---

### 2.2 System Architecture

1. User inputs text via a web interface
2. Text is vectorized using TF-IDF
3. A Logistic Regression model predicts probabilities
4. Results are displayed in real-time using Streamlit

---

### 2.3 Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression
- Streamlit

---

### 2.4 Demo

A live demo is deployed using Streamlit Cloud.

### 2.5 Discussion

This detector is designed for academic demonstration purposes.
While not intended for real-world AI detection, it effectively illustrates
the differences in writing patterns between human-written and AI-generated text.

---

## 3. Q2 — n8n AI Automation Workflow

### 3.1 Objective

To design an AI-powered automation workflow using n8n, inspired by the
“小林 AI” automation concept.

---

### 3.2 Workflow Description

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. Triggered by an incoming Webhook
2. Sends input text to the OpenAI API
3. Receives and returns an AI-generated summary

---

### 3.3 Tools and Platforms

- n8n
- OpenAI API
- Webhook trigger

---

### 3.4 Implementation

The complete workflow is exported as a `workflow.json` file
and stored in the GitHub repository.

A screenshot of the workflow is also provided to demonstrate successfu
